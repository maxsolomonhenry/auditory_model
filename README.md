# Neural Systems Laboratory's Auditory Model
This is an ongoing project to port Powen Ru's auditory model software ("NSL Tools") from Matlab to Python.

Expect the code to change frequently -- the first steps will be copying the language practically verbatim, with the eventual goal of cleaning up and de-Matlabifying things (damn those index values).

If you're curious about the underlying assumptions of the model, please see the excellent documentation at:

Thanks,

-The management.
